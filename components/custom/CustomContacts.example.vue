<!-- 
  Enable:
  - In order to use the custom contacts, make sure that the path
    of the file is components/custom/CustomContacts.vue
  - If you've used scripts to automatically set up the server,
    then the custom contacts should already have the correct path.
  - If you follow the manual installation and the current version
    has an example custom contacts, then simply copy the content of
    CustomContacts.example.vue into CustomContacts.vue

  Environment:
  - Make sure that the custom contacts are enabled in the .env file:
    ENABLE_CUSTOM_CONTACTS=true
  - You can optionally disable default contacts in the .env file:
    ENABLE_DEFAULT_CONTACTS=false

  Updates:
  - CustomContacts.vue is included in the .gitignore, so this file
    should stay persistent even if you update the code to a new
    version, e.g. with 'git pull'.
