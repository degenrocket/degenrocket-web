<!-- 
  Enable:
  - In order to use the custom intro, make sure that the path
    of the file is components/custom/CustomIntro.vue
  - If you've used scripts to automatically set up the server,
    then the custom intro should already have the correct path.
  - If you follow the manual installation and the current version
    has an example custom intro, then simply copy the content of
    CustomIntro.example.vue into CustomIntro.vue

  Environment:
  - Make sure that the custom intro is enabled in the .env file:
    ENABLE_CUSTOM_INTRO=true
  - You can optionally disable default intro in the .env file:
    ENABLE_DEFAULT_INTRO=false

  Updates:
  - CustomIntro.vue is included in the .gitignore, so this file
    should stay persistent even if you update the code to a new
    version, e.g. with 'git pull'.
